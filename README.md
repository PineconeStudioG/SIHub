# SIHub
YouTube front-end designed for consuming self-improvement content

If you are tired of doomscrolling through YouTube consuming meaningless content and want to see useful, educational content about science, psychology, fitness, finance and overall wellbeing then SIHub comes for your rescue.

# How it works
SIHub is not an independent platform - it takes selected YouTube channels and their videos using YouTube API and video embed feature. Then it displays them in non-distracting way so that you can focus on the video itself rather than scroll through comments or list of proposed videos.

# Technologies
This project was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP and tested on tools provided by [XAMPP v3.3.0](https://www.apachefriends.org/)

# Roadmap
Project is not yet finished! It will be continuously developed and improved<br><br>
Most notable improvments to come are:
 ##### - dedicated Android mobile app
Minor fixes to do:
  - fixing disappearing theme change icon when index.html is loading in dark theme

 # Publishing
SIHub is avalible to all internet users at [sihub.szyszyszyszka.pl](https://sihub.szyszyszyszka.pl). Enjoy and do the hard work!
